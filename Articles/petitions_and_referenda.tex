\article{PETITIONS AND REFERENDA}
\section{Referendum}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A referendum vote, on any matter except amendment of the Union Constitution, shall be held
whenever the Student Senate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Approves any form of referendum question proposed by a Senator, Committee, Council,
or petition, by a $\frac{2}{3}$ vote.
\item Receives a petition signed by at least 10\% of all members of the Union, and does not
reject it. Such a petition may only be rejected by a $\frac{2}{3}$ vote of the total voting
membership of the Senate.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{}
The referendum election shall be held at a time determined by the Student Senate, not more than fortyfive
days (exclusive of vacation periods) or at the next regular election, whichever comes first, but in no
case less than fourteen days following its approval. A referendum may be held at any time during the
academic year except during exam periods.

\section{}
A referendum shall become effective if approved by a majority vote of students in a valid referendum
election. A valid referendum election is one in which at least 20 percent of the affected constituency
vote.

\section{}
Upon its passage, a referendum shall be binding upon the constituency. The Student Senate shall enact
any legislation necessary for its implementation. Unless otherwise provided for in the text of the
referendum, it may be rescinded only by a similar referendum.
